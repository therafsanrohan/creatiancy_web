## 2. Admin Settings Configuration Checklist

Before sending the first live invoice, the **Super Admin** must complete this checklist:

* [ ] Log in as a **Super Admin** account.
* [ ] Navigate to **Settings > Business Entities**.
* [ ] Pre-populate **Creatiancy Limited (BDT)** with the Bangladesh bank accounts, BIN, registration number, and address.
* [ ] Pre-populate **Creatiancy LLC (USD)** with the SWIFT, international routing details, EIN, and address.
* [ ] Enter the default payment instructions footer (this saves automatically to new drafts).
* [ ] Go to the **Team** screen and assign roles to your team members' emails as they sign up.

## 3. Production Launch Checklist

* [ ] Connect the GitHub repository to the production project in Vercel.
* [ ] Verify all environment variables match your live Supabase credentials.
* [ ] In your Supabase project, enable **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables.
* [ ] Confirm that your domain CNAME record points to `cname.vercel-dns.com` and that SSL is active at `https://billing.creatiancy.com`.
* [ ] Run calculation test checks.
* [ ] Test the full user flow in Sandbox Mode, then log in to the Live DB mode.
* [ ] Create the first sample invoice, approve it, print to A4, and inspect alignment.

## 4. Known Limitations (V1)

* **Manual Payments Only**: V1 does not process credit card online checkout directly. Payments are logged manually by the Finance Admin or Super Admin upon verifying bank deposits.
* **No Automated Currency Conversion**: Exchange rate calculations between BDT and USD are not automatically computed. Reports display BDT and USD figures separately to prevent mixing rates.
* **Email dispatch via SMTP/Resend API**: Emails are sent using the Resend platform API. Custom sender domains require adding DKIM/SPF DNS records inside Resend settings.
