# Creatiancy Billing Hub V1 — Cloud SaaS Platform

Creatiancy Billing Hub V1 is a multi-tenant, cloud-native SaaS platform built for financial management, corporate billing, 20% automated emergency reserve allocation, FDR/DPS investment tracking, and tax/VAT compliance across **Creatiancy Limited** (Bangladesh / BDT) and **Creatiancy LLC** (United States / USD).

## 🌟 Core Architecture & Capabilities

### 1. 100% Cloud-Native Database Architecture
- **Supabase PostgreSQL Single Source of Truth**: All organization data (invoices, payments, clients, reserve, FDR, DPS, tax, audit logs) is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL.
- **Zero Browser Caching**: No business data is saved to or read from `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or in-memory mock stores.
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Any data created on desktop instantly appears on mobile, tablet, and across all authorized browser sessions.

### 2. Multi-Entity Corporate Billing & Atomic Reserve
- **Dual Entity Management**: Support for **Creatiancy Limited (CLTD - BDT)** and **Creatiancy LLC (CLLC - USD)**.
- **Atomic 20% Reserve Allocation**: Automated PostgreSQL RPC transaction (`record_payment_and_allocate_reserve`) splits incoming payments into 20% emergency reserve and 80% operating cash.
- **FDR & DPS Investment Tracking**: Managed internal asset transfers with strict Row Level Security (RLS).

### 3. Canonical Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Confidential Financial Access
- **Canonical Roles**: `super_admin`, `admin`, `finance`, `client_service`, `project_manager`, `viewer`.
- **Confidential Module Security**: Reserve balances, FDR accounts, DPS records, and company savings are strictly guarded by PostgreSQL RLS policies and accessible only to `super_admin`, `admin`, and `finance`.

## 🌐 Server Routing & Access URLs

- **Main Dashboard / Entry URL**: `https://billing.creatiancy.com` or `https://creatiancy.com/billing` (path `/billing`).
- **Server-Side Session Guard**: Unauthenticated requests to `/billing/*` are redirected to `/login` via Next.js SSR middleware (`src/middleware.ts`).
- **Public Client Invoice View**: `https://your-domain.com/invoice/[secureToken]`.
- **Super Admin Cloud Migration Route**: `/billing/settings/cloud-migration` (Reconcile & import legacy backups).
