## 🛠️ Key Corrective Actions
1. **UUID Standardization:** Replaced all string/mock IDs (`ent-1`, `cli-1`, `usr-1`) with 36-character standard UUID v4 format.
2. **Nullable Field Sanitization:** Replaced empty string `""` values with explicit `null` for optional UUID columns (`account_manager_id`, `bank_account_id`, `vendor_id`).
3. **Atomic Writes:** Wrapped multi-table creation operations (e.g. `invoices` + `invoice_items`, `payments` + `reserve_ledger`) in PostgreSQL atomic RPC transactions to avoid partial inserts.
4. **Live Dropdown Fetching:** Updated UI components to populate entity, client, and manager selections directly from Supabase.
